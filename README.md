face emotion recognition using CNN
This project mainly focuses on determining emotions of a person using deepface library
We have deployed machine learning model in web application.
Here we predict emotion of person and play a random music based on the depicted emotion to change their mood.
We have created a session for the user inorder to ensure security.
This application can also be used to predict the behaviour of a student and help him to be positive and happy
